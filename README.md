# Constellation's CoreOS Config

This is the configuration for [Constellation](https://www.edgeless.systems/products/constellation/)'s node images based on Fedora CoreOS.
It's used by the image build files in the [main repository](https://github.com/edgelesssys/constellation).
It's a fork of [fedora-coreos-config](https://github.com/coreos/fedora-coreos-config).
